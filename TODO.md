  - John
    * command line options
    * log file
    * use library to output image
    * save john version and render stats embedded in image as data
    * ray tree debugging
      - ability to output entire ray tree for all pixels (warning, large file)
        and the visualise this (WebGL viewer?) to debug casting

  - Quality
    * adaptive jitter sampling

  - Lighting
    * soft shadows
    * global illumination
    * spot lights
    * volume lights
    * track energy of ray, disregard once energy drops below threshold
